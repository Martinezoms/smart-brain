# smart-brain
A single face detection web app with login features

# About
  Smart-brain is a simple web app with simple functions. It detects the face of every human image that you can get. It is called a single face detection web app with reason to be that it can only detect one face per image.
  
# Why Smart-brain
  Well, apart from the simple functions that it has which could be really improved for a much more greater importance, it also seems  to be a good practise for junior programmers or beginners on the programming journey on how to make use of APIs and a database on your projects. This web app could be further more advanced in future with new or upgraded functions. For now it just detects a face on an image.
  
# Functionality
  Smart-brain has a login page and a home page. The home page is made up of the insertion box, where you pasted your copied image url to be detected. Before you can use the app, you have to register or sign in of you have already register. smart-brain is secured to use credentials on because the passwords are hashed. Once you have registered, you can now copy any facial image url and paste it on the insertion box. After that, you can now click on the 'Detect' button to load the image and also detect the face on the image. Another feature of the app is that it keeps count of the number of images you've detected it's face right above the insertion box.
